# The-Conversation-Bench
The Conversation Bench is a prototype project made with Arduino and Processing, later to be improved in the outline of the "Creativity and Computation" course at Parsons Paris 2015.


The code is made so that when a button is pushed more than once, the audio file is interrupted and the next file starts playing. Each button has a theme or mood. The prototype is made of four moods: Melancholy, Lonely, Marvelous, Stoic. When a button for another mood is pushed, the previous file is interrupted and the mood's playlist start playing. One push allows one quote to be played. 

The idea of the Conversation Bench came up after realizing how many lonely people sat in Paris' benches by themselves. I wondered: wouldn't it be nice if the bench started talking with them? 

So after testing the code, the next step is to build a box for the buttons. I laser-cutted it from 3mm wood, the file is available in the Process folder. The moods are engraved. 

A few cables were soldered to each button and then connected to the Arduino, fixed inside the wood box. 
The wood box is then attached to a chair, inside of which I put a sound system and the computer that runs the program through Processing. 

Next step will be to build a folding chair that I can fix on a street wall, and use an MP3 Arduino Shield instead of processing to be independent from the computer.
